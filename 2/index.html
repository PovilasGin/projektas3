        <h1>Lithuania</h1>
        <p>
        <span1>For</span1> centuries, the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Baltic tribes. In the 1230s, the Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, and the first unified <span2>Lithuanian</span2> state, the Kingdom of Lithuania, was created on 6 July 1253. During the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe; present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and <span3>Russia</span3> were the territories of the Grand Duchy.
